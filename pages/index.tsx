            Half of the money that is made from all the NFT collections will be
            added into a lotto pool. The lotto pool will live in its own
            contract, the jackpot winner will be added to the contract and only
            the winner can release funds from the lotto pool.

          <p>
            What we usually see is that people like to hold on to the NFT's in
            hopes that "one day the price might increase" - then they can sell
            it and make a profit off it. This is boring, we want something more
            fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            We want all the fun of gambling mixed in with the fun of trading and
            gaming without any of the hassels. We want to get rid of the "saving
            mentality" and make owning and trading NFT's fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are very inspired buy the gaming and artist communities in the
            NFT space. The idea is to make a roadmap of evolution. Everthing on
            this earth evolves and changes - so will we and our collecation. As
            with all lottery systems once the lotto pool has been emptied, it
            much again be refilled.
          </p>
          <p>So...</p>
          <p>
            Once a year - at the beginning of the year we will refill our lotto
            pool, buy releasing new NFT collections. These new collections will
            reflect closely what we observe in the real world with gaming and
            art - Evolution! Taking inspiration from real world games and art
            styles.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will start from the simplest form of 8-bit art from the 80's and
            90's - paying homage to our humble beginnings.
          </p>
          <p>
            For our phase-1 collection we take inspiration from the 1984 classic
            - duck hunt! Let's be honest, this game changed everyone's life.
